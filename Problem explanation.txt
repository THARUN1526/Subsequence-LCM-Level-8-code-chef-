This problem requires finding the number of subsequences of length M in an array that satisfy a given condition. The condition states that for any pair of indices (i, j) in the subsequence S, the expression (lcm(M, Si) - Si) should be equal to (lcm(M, Sj) - Sj), where lcm(a, b) denotes the least common multiple of integers a and b.

To solve this problem, you can follow these steps:

1. Read the number of test cases, T.
2. Iterate T times to process each test case.
3. For each test case, read the length of the array, N.
4. Read the elements of the array.
5. Initialize a variable, count, to store the count of valid subsequences.
6. Iterate over all possible subsequences of length M using nested loops. The outer loop iterates from 0 to N - M, and the inner loop iterates from the current outer loop index + 1 to N - 1.
7. Check if the current subsequence satisfies the given condition. Calculate the expressions (lcm(M, Si) - Si) and (lcm(M, Sj) - Sj) for each pair of indices (i, j) in the subsequence.
8. If the condition is satisfied for all pairs, increment the count by 1.
9. After checking all subsequences, print the value of count modulo 10^9 + 7.

The modulo operation is required to handle large numbers and prevent overflow, as stated in the problem. The modulo value 10^9 + 7 is a commonly used value in programming contests.

Make sure to implement the steps correctly and handle the input and output format as described in the problem statement.
